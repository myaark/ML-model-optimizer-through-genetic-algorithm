# ML-model-optimizer-through-genetic-algorithm
This is my mid term project for the course "Artificial Intelligence" at comsats University Islamabad.

In this project I use scikit learn to train a Machine learning model on the Iris dataset.

The model used is Support Vector Machine.

I have used genetic algorithm to tweak the parameters of SVM to optimize the model.
